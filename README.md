# User and task management tool

> Built with the MERN stack along with Context API and useReducer for state management, React hooks and REST API.

This SPA project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), React Router and constructed with Material UI.

:heavy_check_mark: This is a FullStack app, intended for team-leaders, allowing to manage users, assigning projects and follow up tasks.

:heavy_check_mark: You can track progress and obtain tasks completion statistic at the dashboard section, created with [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs) plugin.

:heavy_check_mark: By clicking on user's avatar or name in the respective tab, you will get an information table about user's to-do's, which can be sorted by priority.
