# User and task management tool

> Built with the MERN stack along with Context API and useReducer for state management, hooks and REST API.

This SPA project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), React Router and constructed with Material UI.

This is a FullStack app, allowing to search and manage users, assign them to projects, and follow their tasks.

:heavy_check_mark: You can track progress and completed to-do's at the dashboard section, created with [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs) plugin.

:heavy_check_mark: By clicking on user's avatar in the projects tab, you will get an information about his to-do's, which can be sorted by your priority.
